# Erase the E-waste

## Introduction

This is the official website for group "E-waste Invention" from SYN 100 Section M Fall 2023 &#x1F9DC;&#x1F9DC;&#x1F9DC;. In our project, we aim to spread awareness on the mistakes often made when recycling and also create a collection program for Seventh college to make e-waste disposal readily available for on campus students. We wish to spread awareness of improper recycling, especially on campus, by creating a guide (in the form of a website) to help students differentiate what should and shouldn‚Äôt be recycled. This website will include information on the dangers of improper recycling and e-waste, why it is important to follow the recycling guide when sorting garbage, and recycling guidances both for recycling certens within UCSD &#x1F9DC; campus and outside public recycling centers.

Alongside the guidance provided in the website, the project will also look into the lack of access for UCSD students regarding e-waste recycling. Interviews will mainly be conducted towards students to better understand the issue of student‚Äôs lack of knowledge of e-waste disposal.

[comment]: # (In addition, The main portion of Project ‚ÄúE-Waste Intervention‚Äù will be centered on the e-waste collection system we hope to implement in Seventh College dorms. Smaller electronic items, such as batteries and e-cigarettes, are often items that students go through quickly and are difficult to dispose of on UCSD campus. Due to this issue, we hope to deploy numerous collection boxes around Seventh College dorms to serve as an e-waste disposal mechanism accessible to Seventh students. )

## Recycling Fact in US

Did you know that the U.S. has only 35% of recycling rate, which is only half of Germany‚Äôs recycling rate?

It is quite shocking, right? &#x1F631; \
Yet, we have various ways to increase our recycling rate of e-wastes on UCSD campus using university facilities!

## Recycling on UCSD Campus &#x1F9DC;

At here, we collected essential all of the recycling information for UCSD students living on campus. If you have any e-waste and don't know how to do with, you are at the right place &#128071;

* &#x1F9EA; Are you doing science/engineering project  that produce lots of e-waste? You can contact UCSD Research Assistance Program (RAP) specialist on your department! They will take care of those wastes. &#x1F449; [click here](https://blink.ucsd.edu/safety/research-lab/laboratory/RAP/contacts.html

    * For small amount:
    
        1. Cover the terminal parts of battery with electrical tape. 

        2. Put them in bags or containers.
